## What is?
If we look at the project PDF, we can see the following statement. **This project is a general practical exercise to let you discover networking**. So we can move on to exploring the world of the network.


### TCP
TCP **(Transmission Control Protocol)**, it is a protocol that enables communication between computers to be carried out in small packets and without loss. The most important part of this protocol is to receive or send data as a whole. Protocols and data records of terms we come across in daily life such as HTTP, HTTPS, POP3, SSH, SMTP, TELNET and FTP are made in TCP form.
